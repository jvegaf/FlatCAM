# FlatCAM Build Workflow Testing Documentation

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the FlatCAM GitHub Actions Build workflow, including automated validation, manual test scenarios, and troubleshooting guides.

## Overview

The FlatCAM Build workflow (`build-appimage.yml`) automates the process of:
- Building FlatCAM AppImage packages
- Running tests and validations
- Creating GitHub releases
- Managing artifacts and distributions

## Testing Infrastructure

### 1. Automated Validation Tests

**Script**: `.github/workflow-validation-tests.sh`

Runs comprehensive validation of workflow configuration:
```bash
# Run all validation tests
./.github/workflow-validation-tests.sh
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Workflow file structure validation
- ✅ Trigger configuration validation  
- ✅ Security and permissions validation
- ✅ Job configuration validation
- ✅ Build environment validation
- ✅ Version detection validation
- ✅ Dependency installation validation
- ✅ Build artifacts validation
- ✅ Error handling validation
- ✅ Concurrency control validation
- ✅ Release process validation
- ✅ AppImage configuration validation

### 2. Component Tests

**Script**: `.github/test-workflow-components.sh`

Tests critical workflow components:
```bash
# Test individual components
./.github/test-workflow-components.sh
```

**Coverage**:
- Source code zip creation
- AppImage build infrastructure
- Python project structure
- Required files verification

### 3. Manual Testing Suite

**Script**: `.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh`

Provides guided manual testing for different scenarios:
```bash
# Show available test scenarios
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh help

# Test specific scenarios
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh test-push-main
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh test-tag-release
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Push to Main Branch

**Trigger**: Push commits to `main` branch
**Expected Behavior**:
- Workflow triggers automatically
- Creates development build with version `2024.4-dev.{commit}`
- Uploads AppImage as artifact (30-day retention)
- Does NOT create GitHub release

**Testing Steps**:
```bash
# Create test commit
echo "# Test commit $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test workflow: development build"
git push origin main
```

**Validation**:
- Monitor workflow execution at GitHub Actions
- Verify artifact upload with correct naming
- Confirm no release is created
- Check build logs for errors

### Scenario 2: Tag-Based Release

**Trigger**: Push version tags (format: `v*`)
**Expected Behavior**:
- Workflow triggers on tag push
- Creates stable build with tag version
- Creates GitHub release (not prerelease)
- Uploads AppImage as release asset
- Generates release notes

**Testing Steps**:
```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag v2024.4-test
git push origin v2024.4-test
```

**Validation**:
- Verify release creation with correct version
- Check AppImage asset attachment
- Validate release notes content
- Confirm release is marked as stable

### Scenario 3: Manual Workflow Dispatch (Build Only)

**Trigger**: Manual trigger via GitHub UI
**Expected Behavior**:
- Runs on demand
- Creates development build
- Uploads artifact
- No release creation (when `create_release = false`)

**Testing Steps**:
1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Build and Release AppImage"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Leave "Create a new release" unchecked
4. Click "Run workflow"

**Validation**:
- Workflow runs successfully
- Artifact is created
- No release is created

### Scenario 4: Manual Workflow Dispatch (With Release)

**Trigger**: Manual trigger with release creation
**Expected Behavior**:
- Runs on demand
- Creates development build
- Creates prerelease
- Uploads AppImage as release asset

**Testing Steps**:
1. Go to GitHub Actions → "Build and Release AppImage"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Check "Create a new release"
4. Click "Run workflow"

**Validation**:
- Workflow runs successfully
- Release is created and marked as prerelease
- AppImage is attached to release

### Scenario 5: Error Handling

**Trigger**: Intentional build failure
**Expected Behavior**:
- Workflow fails gracefully
- Clear error messages in logs
- No artifacts or releases created
- Proper cleanup

**Testing Steps**:
```bash
# Create failure test
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh simulate-failure
```

**Validation**:
- Workflow fails at expected step
- Error messages are informative
- No partial artifacts remain
- Subsequent runs work normally

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Timing
- **Source preparation**: 1-2 minutes
- **Dependency installation**: 5-10 minutes  
- **AppImage creation**: 10-15 minutes
- **Total workflow time**: 20-30 minutes (under 45-minute timeout)

### Expected Artifact Sizes
- **Source zip**: ~1-2 MB
- **Final AppImage**: 200-500 MB

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check performance metrics
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh performance-test
```

## Security Validation

### Permissions Audit
- ✅ Minimal permissions: `contents: write`, `actions: read`
- ✅ No excessive permissions granted
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets

### Dependencies Security
- ✅ Official GitHub Actions only
- ✅ Pinned action versions
- ✅ No untrusted third-party actions

### Runtime Security
```bash
# Run security scan
./.github/manual-workflow-tests.sh security-scan
```

## AppImage Functionality Testing

### Basic Functionality
```bash
# Download and test AppImage
wget [AppImage-URL]
chmod +x FlatCAM-*.AppImage

# Test help
./FlatCAM-*.AppImage --help

# Test GUI
./FlatCAM-*.AppImage
```

### Compatibility Testing
Test on multiple Linux distributions:
- Ubuntu 18.04+
- Fedora 30+
- openSUSE Leap 15+
- Arch Linux

### Functional Testing
1. Load Gerber files
2. Generate isolation routing
3. Export G-code
4. Verify all core functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Timeout**
- **Symptom**: Workflow times out after 45 minutes
- **Solution**: Check for hanging processes, optimize dependencies
- **Prevention**: Monitor build times regularly

**AppImage Creation Fails**
- **Symptom**: AppImage build step fails
- **Solution**: Check AppImageBuilder.yml syntax, verify dependencies
- **Debug**: Review build logs for specific errors

**Version Detection Issues**
- **Symptom**: Incorrect version in build
- **Solution**: Verify pyproject.toml format, check git fetch-depth
- **Debug**: Test version detection script locally

**Artifact Upload Fails**
- **Symptom**: Artifact upload step fails
- **Solution**: Check file paths, verify artifact exists
- **Debug**: List build directory contents in workflow

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test version detection locally
grep '^version' FlatCAM/pyproject.toml | sed -E 's/version = *["'"'"']?([^"'"'"' ]+)["'"'"']?/\1/'

# Test zip creation locally
publish/create_zipapp.sh

# Validate AppImage config
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('publish/appimage/AppImageBuilder.yml')))"

# Check workflow syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/build-appimage.yml'))"
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor workflow success rates
- Check artifact sizes and build times
- Review dependency updates
- Validate security configurations

### Update Procedures
1. Test changes in feature branch first
2. Run all validation tests
3. Perform manual testing scenarios
4. Monitor first production run

### Metrics to Track
- Build success rate
- Average build time
- Artifact download counts
- User feedback on AppImage functionality
