# FlatCAM AppImage Workflow Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the newly implemented GitHub Actions workflow for building and releasing FlatCAM AppImage builds.

## Workflow Implementation Summary

✅ **Complete Implementation:**
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/build-appimage.yml`
- Comprehensive documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`
- Test suite in `.github/test-workflow-components.sh`
- Updated `.gitignore` for build artifacts
- Fixed executable permissions for build scripts

✅ **Local Testing Results:**
All 5 critical components validated successfully:
1. ✅ Source code preparation (zip creation)
2. ✅ AppImage build infrastructure 
3. ✅ Python project structure
4. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow syntax
5. ✅ Required files verification

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Basic Workflow Validation (After PR Merge)

**Test Push to Main Branch:**
```bash
# After PR is merged to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
echo "# Test commit" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test workflow: development build"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:**
- Workflow triggers on push to main
- Creates development build with version like `2024.4-dev.abc1234`
- Uploads AppImage as artifact
- Does NOT create release (main branch push)

### 2. Release Creation Testing

**Test Stable Release:**
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v2024.4-test
git push origin v2024.4-test
```

**Expected Result:**
- Workflow triggers on tag push
- Creates stable build with version `2024.4-test`
- Creates GitHub release titled "FlatCAM 2024.4-test"
- Uploads AppImage as release asset
- Release marked as stable (not prerelease)

**Test Pre-release:**
```bash
# Create and push a pre-release tag
git tag v2024.5-beta1
git push origin v2024.5-beta1
```

**Expected Result:**
- Workflow triggers on tag push
- Creates build with version `2024.5-beta1`
- Creates GitHub release titled "FlatCAM 2024.5-beta1"
- Release marked as prerelease
- Includes installation instructions

### 3. Manual Workflow Testing

**Test Manual Dispatch (Development Build):**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build and Release AppImage"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Leave "Create a new release" unchecked
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Expected Result:**
- Manual build with dev version
- AppImage artifact uploaded
- No release created

**Test Manual Dispatch (Force Release):**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build and Release AppImage"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check "Create a new release"
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Expected Result:**
- Manual build with dev version
- AppImage artifact uploaded
- Development release created (marked as prerelease)

### 4. Error Handling Testing

**Test Invalid Build:**
```bash
# Temporarily break the build to test error handling
git checkout -b test-failure
echo "invalid python syntax" > FlatCAM/__init__.py
git add FlatCAM/__init__.py
git commit -m "Test build failure handling"
git push origin test-failure
```

**Expected Result:**
- Workflow should fail gracefully
- Clear error messages in logs
- No artifacts or releases created
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

## Verification Checklist

### Build Process Verification
- [ ] Source zip creation succeeds
- [ ] All required dependencies installed
- [ ] AppImage builds without errors
- [ ] AppImage file is executable
- [ ] AppImage size is reasonable (should be 200-500MB)
- [ ] Build artifacts properly cleaned up

### Release Process Verification
- [ ] Correct version detection from tags/pyproject.toml
- [ ] Proper release naming (stable vs development)
- [ ] Release notes generated correctly
- [ ] AppImage uploaded as release asset
- [ ] Download links work correctly
- [ ] Installation instructions are clear

### Workflow Logic Verification
- [ ] Concurrency control works (cancels previous runs)
- [ ] Job dependencies work correctly
- [ ] Conditional execution works (release only for tags)
- [ ] Permissions are minimal and appropriate
- [ ] Error handling is graceful

## AppImage Functionality Testing

### Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Download AppImage from release
wget https://github.com/jvegaf/FlatCAM/releases/download/v2024.4-test/FlatCAM-2024.4-test-x86_64.AppImage

# Make executable and test
chmod +x FlatCAM-2024.4-test-x86_64.AppImage

# Test basic execution (should show help or start GUI)
./FlatCAM-2024.4-test-x86_64.AppImage --help

# Test on different Linux distributions
# - Ubuntu 18.04+
# - Fedora 30+
# - openSUSE Leap 15+
# - Arch Linux
```

### Integration Test
```bash
# Test with actual PCB files
./FlatCAM-2024.4-test-x86_64.AppImage
# Load a Gerber file
# Generate isolation routing
# Export G-code
# Verify functionality
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Logs
- Check build logs for dependency installation
- Monitor AppImage creation process
- Verify artifact upload/download
- Check release creation logs

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Fails on Dependency Installation:**
- Check Ubuntu package availability
- Verify AppImage builder download
- Check Python environment setup

**AppImage Creation Fails:**
- Verify AppImageBuilder.yml syntax
- Check source zip creation
- Validate patch files application
- Monitor disk space usage

**Release Creation Fails:**
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Verify tag format
- Check for existing releases
- Monitor artifact download

## Performance Metrics

Expected build times:
- **Source preparation**: 1-2 minutes
- **Dependency installation**: 5-10 minutes
- **AppImage creation**: 10-15 minutes
- **Total workflow time**: 20-30 minutes

Expected artifact sizes:
- **Source zip**: ~1-2 MB
- **Final AppImage**: 200-500 MB

## Success Criteria

The workflow implementation is considered successful when:

1. ✅ All test scenarios pass without errors
2. ✅ AppImage builds are functional and executable
3. ✅ Releases are created with proper versioning
4. ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
5. ✅ Error handling is robust and informative
6. ✅ Performance meets expected metrics
7. ✅ Security practices are followed (minimal permissions)

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Monitor initial releases** for any issues
2. **Gather user feedback** on AppImage functionality
3. **Optimize build times** if needed
4. **Add additional platforms** (ARM64) if requested
5. **Integrate with existing CI/CD** processes
6. **Document deployment procedures** for maintainers
